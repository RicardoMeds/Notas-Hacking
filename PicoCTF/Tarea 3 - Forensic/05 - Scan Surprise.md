#### Pista 
QR codes are a way of encoding data. While they're most known for storing URLs, they can store other things too.
Mobile phones have included native QR code scanners in their cameras since version 8 (Oreo) and iOS 11
If you don't have access to a phone, you can also use zbar-tools to convert an image to text

solo comprimi y use un convertidor de QR a texto y me dio la bandera
